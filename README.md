## Rules

The game of Set operates by a few simple rules. This is essentially a pattern-finding card game. There is a deck of 81 unique cards. Each card has four features, in which there are three options for each feature. The features are shape, number, color, and texture. The possible shapes are {oval, diamond, squiggle}. The possible numbers are {1, 2, 3}. The possible colors are {red, green, purple}. The possible textures are {blank, striped, full}. For a more detailed explanation of what these definitions are, see the official Set Card Game website for instructions (https://www.setgame.com/set) 

To play, each round, 12 cards are dealt. A set consists of three cards in which for each of the four features of the cards in the set, the features are either all the same or all different between the three cards.
